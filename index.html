        <h1>Expense Calculator</h1>
        <p>An Expense Calculator is a simple and 
            useful tool that helps users manage and 
            divide financial costs efficiently. It
            allows you to input the total amount of
             money spent and the number of people
              sharing the expense. With just a click, 
              it quickly calculates how much each 
              person needs to pay. This kind of 
              calculator is especially helpful 
              in situations like splitting bills 
              during trips, group meals, or shared
              living expenses. By automating the math,
               it reduces confusion, saves time, and
                ensures fair cost distribution among 
                all participants.</p>
